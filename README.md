# Sentinel-Crime-Analytics-Chicago
# Objective
The project goes beyond simple crime statistics and provides Actionable Intelligence for security deployments. Instead of where the crime occurred, the system identifies # High # Risk # Zones through a weighted severity index and tactical hotspots through a clustering algorithm called # DBSCAN.
